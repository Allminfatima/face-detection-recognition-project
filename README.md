# face-detection-recognition-project

## Description
This project demonstrates a real-time face recognition system built using Python and OpenCV. The system trains a face recognizer model with labeled images, performs real-time face detection and recognition via webcam, and saves the recognized face data along with confidence scores and timestamps into an Excel file. The project also handles error scenarios and adjusts the camera UI for better visibility.

## Features
- Train face recognizer model with images.
- Real-time face detection and recognition using webcam.
- Save recognized face data, confidence scores, and timestamps to an Excel file.
- Dynamic camera UI adjustments.
- Error handling and data visualization.

## Files
- train_face_recognizer.py: Script to train the face recognizer model.
- train.py: Script to perform real-time face recognition and save results to an Excel file.
- photos/: Directory containing images for training.
